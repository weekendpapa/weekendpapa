# Hello,

My name is Anders and I am a Fashion Merchandising graduate from the University of Georgia. I enjoy learning about coding and programming,
and use this github account to keep track of my projects.

I am currently working on making my website portfolio, which I use when applying to jobs to show some of the work I have done.
I am currently learning Javascript to become a better front end developer.

There is still a lot for me to learn, so feel free to reach out.
Hope to hear from you soon!
